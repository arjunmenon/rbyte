Ruby byte code library.

There are a few major bugs with byte encoding in Ruby 1.9.1 so,
to use this library, you need to use Ruby's trunk.

Installation:
  sudo gem install rbyte

Usage:
  Rbyte.compile_file(path)
  Rbyte.decompile_file(path)
  
  # To make RBC files automatically be required
  Kernel.send(:include, Rbyte::RequirePatch)
  require "my_rbc_file"
