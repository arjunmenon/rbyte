Ruby byte code library.

Not for production use just yet, since Ruby's byte compiling
supports a limit subset of Ruby files. Anything that isn't wrapped in a class doesn't seem to work. These bugs are 
fixed in Ruby's trunk.

Requires Ruby 1.9.1

Setup:
  ruby extconf.rb
  make

Usage:
  Rbyte.compile_file(path)
  Rbyte.decompile_file(path)
  
  # To make RBC files automatically be required
  Kernel.send(:include, Rbyte::RequirePatch)
  require "my_rbc_file"
